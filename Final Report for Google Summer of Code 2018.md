# Final Report for Google Summer of Code 2018 

This is a final report of the work which was done as part of *Government Gazette text mining, cross linking, and codification Project* (or 3gm for short) using [Natural Language Processing Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and Practices hosted in [github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-3gm](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-3gm) and [3gm.ellak.gr](https://3gm.ellak.gr).

## Abstract

This project aims to provide with the most recent versions of each law, i.e. an automated [**codex**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)) via _Natural Language Processing (NLP)_ methods and practices on **Greek Legislation**, along with additional functionality such as topic modeling for similarity analysis, versioning system in MongoDB, continuous integration tools & scripts and a [web application](http://3gm.ellak.gr). The **accuracy** of detecting amendments on Greek Legislation texts was 85%.
