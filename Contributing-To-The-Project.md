# Contributing to the project

## Workflow For Contributors

If you want to contribute to the project you should know that we are using the standardised [Fork and Pull Request Workflow for GitHub](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962). So:

1. Fork the project.
2. Sync with upstream.
3. Checkout to a new branch referring to your change. For example if you are working on issue #3 you should create a branch called `issue#3`.
4. Work on the changes and commit them to the branch.
5. Submit a pull request:
   1. Make sure that you are not submitting multiple PRs for the same ticket.
   2. Make sure that the tests pass successfully. We are using Travis CI for running them. 
   3. Squash multiple commits to one with `git rebase -i`.
   4. Outline your changes descriptively on the PR text. 
   5. Wait for the community to review the PR and make the appropriate changes to be ready for merging.
6. Woah! Now you are a real contributor!

## Future Work

### Training statistical models with custom tag maps

In order to further improve the accuracy of the amendment detection algorithm, we propose [training a statistical model](https://spacy.io/usage/training) with a [custom tag map with custom parts of speech (POS)](https://spacy.io/api/tagger). This training can be done with tools such as [prodigy.ai](https://spacy.io/api/tagger) in order to construct [a custom treebank](https://github.com/papachristoumarios/UD_Greek-GDT) with the needed dependencies. Then we can detect the amendment with a simple [tree traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal). 

### Differential versioning with MongoDB

In this stage the various versions of the statutes are kept in records in GridFS. In order to minify the chunks created by GridFS we propose the development of differential versioning for keeping track of the history. This can be done via invoking the [`diff`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) UNIX tool. The goal is to build a tool like `git` (or even migrate completely to git).

### Digitize Older documents (pre-1999)

The pre-1999 (1976-1999) documents of the Greek Government Gazette need OCR in order to be read. There has been an attempt to digitize them using Google Tesseract v4.0 OCR Engine with neat results in the years 1990-1999. For better results, however, either a custom LSTM model (as Google Tesseract utilizes) needs to be trained in order to detect the Greek typographic elements from the Government Gazette Issues or the gathering of documents from another sources needs to be done.

### Add executive decisions extraction

The codifier module currently detects, codifies and stores all laws and presidential decrees that are found in the Greek Government Gazette issues. Even though these types of amendments are most important in greek legislation they do not account for the largest part of GGG issues. It is therefore vital to expand amendment extraction to other types of amendments such as parliamentary acts and regulations, executive decisions, acts of appointment etc. Expanding extraction to other types of decisions and acts will help us better understand the continuity and interaction between the legislative and executive branches.


**Any further feedback on future improvements and work is always appreciated.**

## For lawyers

If you are a lawyer, you are very helpful to us. We would like you to tell us:

1. If the laws are applied in the right order

2. If there are legal texts that are absent

3. If the topic is satisfactoryÂ   

## For computer scientists

If you are a computer scientist, you are very helpful to us. You can contribute to:

1. Rebuilding older texts. To do this, you can visit the [Internet Archive Project](https://archive.org/details/GreekGovernmentGazette). 
2. Help us with ideas about Natural Language Processing algorithms (NLP) or other Machine Learning Algorithms to improve the detection of modifications or add features to the project in general.
3. If you find a problem, or want to suggest some improvement, [open an issue](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-3gm/issues).
4. If you want to study the structure of the project, you can see [the code](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-3gm) and [the wiki](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-3gm/wiki)
